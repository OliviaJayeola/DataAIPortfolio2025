# Sentiment analysis with pytorch and huggingface

A quick sentiment analysis project to re-familiarise myself with NLP pre-processing with huggingface and pytorch

Reached highest accuracy with XGBOOST at ~ 50%, 25% above chance for 4 labels

May go back and create a structured class and functions for this project, with a custom parameter search algorithm to find optimal parameters and pre-processing techniques
